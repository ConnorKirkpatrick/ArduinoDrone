This web server is intended to be run off of a rasberry pi 2011
It will host a local web server with a website allowing the user to broadcast data such as coordinates or view flight data
this will only be available on short range connections. Possibly in future this will be changed to radio controlled, with
the webserver being fed info through that downlonk rather than directly
